# A Wild Dev Appears main site

This is my main site, it is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started), the static site genenrator.

In order to run the server for this project, you will need to run:

```
hugo server -D
```

The -D option allows pages in draft mode to be visible.
See Hugos docs (linked above) for more information on how Hugo works.
