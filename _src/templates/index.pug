      p.
        This site mostly exists simply as a basis for me to work on, I plan to upgrade this site as I go, adding new functionality
        and features. None of what you see here is final. It may not always look the way it does, it may not stay on Github.io's servers,
        it may not even stay written in the languages it is, it all depends on how I decide to move forward with this.

      p
        | This site has been built using SCSS as a CSS preprocessor, using my own selection of tools (some of which I have built)
        | to aid me in styling up this site, for the pages, I have used Pug, formally Jade, as a transpiler, my reasoning behind this
        | is so that I can make it a lot easier to edit and manipulate shared areas of the page, without touching every page file.
        | The idea behind this site build is to allow it to me as easy as possible for me to maintain and completely alter as I see fit.

        li

            without flexbox.
