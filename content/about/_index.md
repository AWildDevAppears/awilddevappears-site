# About me

I am a Front End developer cross Android/Hybrid app developer.
I build websites, and Native and Hybrid apps. In my spare time I build indie games and apps for fun (though I've never released any).

I have a passion for writing fast, reliable, reusable front end code, to the point where I have worked on building my own toolkits to serve this purpose. I have worked with several design standards like BEM and Atomic design and have tried to incorporate the best bits of all of them into my programming.

I also have a great love for accessibility, and building products that can be used by anyone, regardless of whether they have disabilities or even if they not digesting our content using a browser (Screen reader, crawler or other bot.)

I have worked on several different projects, with several different technologies and in many different ways, I have mostly worked on Agile projects but have experience with waterfall style development.
