In late 2018, I decided to rebuild my site. It was never really finished in the first place and it was written in old or obscure technologies, I didn't like it. Pug was great, but I've always been a fan of being able to just write HTML and my build tooling was clunky to say the least.

I'd heard about Hugo while reading about different static site generators, I liked the fact that Hugo is written in Go, a language I love, and the features it promised looked reasonably good. What did I have to lose, I thought, If I hate it, I can just start again! There was no time contraint on this thing, so I could have fun with it.

When I started using Hugo, I was working through the getting started guide, it was quite well written, explanitory and helpful. I got up the the point where they started mentioning a theme, that's when I knew, I'm definitely building my own theme. I already had a design planned out from my old site, all I had to do was build it.
