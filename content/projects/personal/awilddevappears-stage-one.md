Stage one of the AWildDevAppears site was built using SCSS as a CSS preprocessor, using my own selection of tools (some of which I have built) to aid me in styling up this site, for the pages, I used Pug, formally Jade, as a transpiler, my reasoning behind this is so that I can make it a lot easier to edit and manipulate shared areas of the page, without touching every page file. The idea behind the site build was to allow it to me as easy as possible for me to maintain and completely alter as I see fit.
